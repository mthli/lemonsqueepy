Before run this project:

- TODO
- Put `./lemon.mthli.com.conf` to `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` directory.
- Execute `sudo certbot --nginx -d lemon.mthli.com` to generate certificates, or
- Execute `sudo certbot renew` to avoid certificates expired after 90 days.

Then just execute commands as follow:

```bash
# Make sure you are not in pipenv shell.
pm2 start ./pm2.json
```
